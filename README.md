# About
This is simple forward propagation neural network to recognize drawn numbers for learning purposes

## How to run
Clone this repo:

> git clone https://github.com/SpekalsG3/Number-Recognition-Neural-Network.git

go to created folder/src/ and run main.py:

> main.py

## How to train

### By hand:

There is a checkbox labled "Training" whether to teach neural network comparing your drawing and the digit entered in the box to the left of checkbox.

### By dataset:

There's the button up top which let's you open dataset like [The MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

### Save trained model:

There's the second button up top which let's you save model of current neural network in .json format.
